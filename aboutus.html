      <h2>A Brief Background of the Company</h2>
      <p>
       DATAFIL LLC was created and registered in the US state of Wyoming on November 3rd 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amidst a surge of foreign students heading to the Philippines to pursue medical studies, there was a growing need for academic guidance, career counseling, and support in navigating daily challenges. Recognizing this, founders Scott Wallace and Prajjwal Tamang, both holders of Doctor of Medicine degrees, decided to combine their business insight with their medical experience. Their goal was to bridge the gap between student needs and meaningful support through a platform built on both academic and professional understanding.
      <p>
      With a vision to offer comprehensive assistance tailored to aspiring medical professionals, they created a pathway that not only helped students gain placements but also provided mentorship and expertise grounded in real-world medical practice. From that foundation, DataFil began empowering international medical students with an accessible route to pursue their dreams of practicing medicine in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>With offices in the United States, India, Nepal, Malaysia, and the Philippines, DataFil is proud of its global presence and deeply personal approach. We are here to ensure that no student feels alone on their journey. Through personalized care, professional guidance, and a genuine commitment to our students’ success, we aim to create a future where every international student feels seen, supported, and confident each day. While far away from home, our students are never left to navigate things on their own. From the moment they arrive in the Philippines, they know they have someone here who truly cares.
      </p>
      <p>Unlike many services that step back after admission, we stay present, involved, and ready to help in real ways. From the small daily concerns to the big academic milestones, we remain by your side throughout your entire academic life in the Philippines. Under our care and mentorship, we will help you build your core competencies until you graduate successfully and move forward with strength in your chosen careers.
